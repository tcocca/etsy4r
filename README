etsy4r
======

etsy4r is a Ruby wrapper for the Etsy API.  It utilizes the amazing HTTParty gem by John Nunemaker.
If you need to build an API wrapper that gem is an enourmous help, refer to the following:

http://railstips.org/2008/7/29/it-s-an-httparty-and-everyone-is-invited

etsy4r wraps all of the etsy api calls into 1 nice library.  Etsy's API is currenly in beta so this library will probably 
be changing frequently.  Most likely their will only be additions.

One thing that does not exist in the Etsy API is the ability to grab all the images for a listing so I have written a parser based on
Hpricot.  This may dissapear when etsy releases a call to get all images to their API.


Etsy API
=========

The Etsy api is currently in beta.  See this blog post for details:
http://www.etsy.com/storque/etsy-news/tech-updates-handmade-code-etsys-beta-api-3055/

You will need to email their development staff to get access to the API setion of the website before you can 
register for an API key which you will need to do.
